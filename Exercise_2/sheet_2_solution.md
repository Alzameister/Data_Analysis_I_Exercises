# Exercise Sheet 2

## Exercise 1

### b)

The mean of the participants younger than 35 is 689.22 +/- 3.64 minutes.
The mean of the participants older than 35 is 704.43 +/- 2.44 minutes

Looking at the uncertainty, we can conclude that the group of participants younger than 35 is the faster group ,
as there is not overlap between the two uncertainties.

### d)

All the values are close to the results from (a), but have small variations since we have lost some detail in the values by matching them to the bins.
The means don't really change with different bin widths, while the variance and the standard deviation decrease with more bins.

### e)

The cov / correlation of total rank and total time is highly positive, which means that the better the rank, the lower the time, which is expected as the rank is based on the time. This can also be observed in the plot.

The cov / correlation of total time and age is positive, which means that the older the participant, the worse their time. This is also expected as usually younger people can achieve better performance. However the correlation is not that high due to the fact that people have different fitness levels which can compensate for the age. This can be seen in the plot, where we see quite a big spread but overall a slight increase in the total time as the age increases.

The cov / correlation of total time and swimming time is highly positive, which is also expected as the swimming time is a part of the total time. This higher correlation can be seen in the plot, where we have quite a narrow distribution that steadily increases.

The cov / correlation of cycling time and running time is highly positive, which is expected as if one has a better cycling time, it should indicate a higher fitness level and thus also better running time.

The covariance of total time in minutes and age is a lot lower than if the total time is measured in time, whereas correlation stays the same. This is due to the fact that covariance is highly susceptible to different scaling effects, and correlation takes that into account by dividing by the multiplication of the standard deviations.

## Exercise 2

### b)
The natural background radiation is 2.4 mSv/y. From the result of the code, the average radiation in that room is between 2.590590 and 2.590605 mSv/y. This is definitively higher than the natural background radiation.
